# bakerTheme
R colour and fonts (sorry, no fonts, need to add that at a later stage) for ggplot that apply to baker hughes standars
Nothing fancy, just colour and fonts to apply to your R code to make it look a little bit more bakerish.

At the moment it consist of two different function famelies.

theme_baker():
One theme_baker() that is based on theme_bw and changes (font to poppins, no) and colour to the two base colours for baker
theme_baker_dark()
Changes background to dark and text to white and ligth grey

Two other functions:
baker_fill and baker_colour that changes the default colour palette to baker hughes. Only distinct

baker_fill_ligth and baker_colour_ligth that are best used with the dark mode graphs
